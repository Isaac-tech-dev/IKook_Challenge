Welcome to the IKOOk Pop-Up Page Assignment. In this assignment, my task is to create a pop-up page in a React Native application. This README provides an overview of the assignment, instructions, and guidelines to help you complete the task successfully.

## Assignment Overview

The React Native Pop-Up Page Assignment focuses on the creation of a single pop-up page within a React Native app. This pop-up page can be used for various purposes, such as displaying messages, collecting user input, or confirming actions. Your goal is to design and implement this pop-up page, ensuring it is visually appealing and functional.

## Instructions

1. **Setup**: Start by cloning this repository to your local development environment and ensure you have a React Native project set up.

2. **Design the Pop-Up**: Design the pop-up page according to the app's theme and purpose. Consider the following elements:
   - Layout and placement of UI components within the pop-up.
   - Use of colors, fonts, and styles that align with the app's branding.
   - Ensure the pop-up is visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. **Functionality**: Implement the necessary functionality for the pop-up page. Depending on its purpose, this might include:
   - Accepting user input or selections.
   - Displaying relevant information.
   - Triggering actions or confirming choices.

4. **Integration**: If the pop-up page interacts with other parts of the app, ensure that it integrates seamlessly. For instance, if it collects user data, make sure that data is properly handled and stored.

5. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the pop-up page to ensure it functions as expected. Test different user interactions and edge cases to ensure it is robust.

6. **Documentation**: Document the code for the pop-up page. Include comments for key components, functions, or libraries used. Additionally, provide a brief explanation of how the pop-up page works.

7. **Submission**: When the pop-up page is complete, follow the submission instructions provided by your instructor or employer.
